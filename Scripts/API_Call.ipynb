Shuster who assumed the position of Copeland's first chief executive officer (CEO).</p><p> JARN (J): As the top decision-maker at Copeland, what new impetus do you plan to bring to this century-old company?</p><p> Ross</p><p> B. Shuster (S) : We see opportunities to make Copeland even stronger by investing in the growth of the business. People may think Copeland is a company that only produces scroll compressors and is North America centric. However, Copeland is a global company with a wide breadth of products. In fact, nearly half of our revenues come from outside the United States and we have a broad offering of compressors from scroll, to reciprocating, screw, and now centrifugal types. In addition, approximately 20% of our business is in electronics and controls.</p><p> In order to become a stronger company, we are investing in four areas for growth where we see opportunities. These are in the areas of heat pumps, commercial segment products, and industrial segment products areas, as well as in our controls business. Today only about 30% of our business is in the commercial segment, but globally this segment represents nearly half of the global HVAC&amp;R market. Therefore, we are focusing on growing our presence in the commercial market, and the recent release of our oil-free centrifugal compressor is one example of that.</p><p> J: Please tell us the approximate sales breakdown of your current business in the Americas.</p><p> S : In the Americas, we have a broad breadth of technologies that serve the residential air conditioning, commercial air conditioning, refrigeration, and industrial segments. In 2023, we estimate that the residential air conditioning segment accounted for 35% of our Americas business, refrigeration 30%, commercial air conditioning 25%, and industrial 10%. We see growth opportunities in all of them.</p><p> J: Recently, Chinese and South Korean compressor manufacturers launched production in Mexico, etc., targeting the North American market. How do you see this trend as the scroll compressor giant?</p><p> S : We like competition because it drives us to make sure we are investing in research and development (R&amp;D) and in ways to get better. We will spend about 4% of our revenues in R&amp;D and engineering, to ensure we stay ahead of other competitors' developments. In fact, we are already developing the next generation of scroll compressors that will continue to position us a technology leader in this area. In addition, we are aggressively broadening our offerings for different applications, including larger-capacity scroll compressors, screw compressors, semi-hermetic compressors for commercial refrigeration, and oil-free centrifugal compressors.</p><p> J: Could you tell us your new oilfree centrifugal compressor in detail?</p><p> S : At the AHR Expo we are displaying our new oil-free centrifugal compressor. We believe it is highly differentiated because it employs our unique Aero-lift bearing technology, which is engineered to be a worry-free alternative to existing magnetic levitation bearings and refrigerant-lubricated ceramic compression technologies. Compatible with lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, the new oil-free centrifugal compressor is optimized for high-lift performance and higher reliability, efficiency, and serviceability in demanding chiller applications. With these advantages, we think this compressor is well positioned for many applications but particularly for data center applications.</p><p> J:</p><p> When will you start production of this new oil-free compressor?</p><p> S : We have customers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are now piloting this compressor in all parts of the world. Our oilfree compressor is now available in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. We will then expand its production to other locations. We have 26 manufacturing locations around the world, so we can use those existing footprints to accelerate the production.</p><p> J: Where are your important markets globally?</p><p> S : Every market is now offering different opportunities for growth. Even some of the t raditionally smaller markets are growing with different needs. For example, the Canadian market is growing with industrial CO2 cold storage and district heating, and the Latin American market is growing with smaller format refrigeration equipment and controls.</p><p> To meet such respective market needs, we have a global presence with production ability and solutions. In Asia, we own two manufacturing sites, one in Suzhou, China, and one in Thailand. We also have production facilities in India and the Middle East, which are our longterm strong growth markets in addition to Africa. In Europe, we have three manufacturing centers. Europe has become one of our strongest growth markets with the move to electrify heating. Regarding the U.S. market, we see a lot of opportunities to grow because of its large scale.</p><p> J: What are the current trends and challenges in the HVAC&amp;R industry in your opinion, and how does Copeland respond to them as a global leader?</p><p> S : One of the challenges we are facing \\\\u2013 which is also an opportunity \\\\u2013is the varying regional moves to higher energy efficiency regulations and lower GWP refrigerants. Depending upon the part of the world or the industry, the path to lower GWP refrigerants is different. For example, on the refrigeration side, we see a mix of propane (R290), CO2, and A2L refrigerants in both Europe and the United States. However, on the heating and cooling side, the European heat pump market is taking the R290 path, while the U.S. air conditioning market is heading down the path with R454B and R32.</p><p> Therefore, we are investing in all of those possibilities in order to support the different paths which get us to the point of low-GWP refrigerants. As much as 90% of our R&amp;D is directly or indirectly tied to products supporting new refrigerants.</p><p> J: In recent years, there have been many large-scale mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) in the global HVAC&amp;R industry. Are you also interested in M&amp;As?</p><p> S : We are obviously interested in growing organically, but now we also have the ability, and the focus as a standalone company, to invest in M&amp;A to grow inorganically. We would look to invest in areas where we see emerging technologies or where we may have gaps. We also look to invest in local companies where we can help them become more global, leveraging our manufacturing and sales footprint. There are a lot of emerging, but not yet commercialized technologies in the HVAC&amp;R industry. We can work with some of these younger technologies, bringing in our engineering resources to help mature and commercialize them, utilizing our relationships across the industry in order to get those technologies embedded within the industry.</p><p> J: You play an important role in the HVAC&amp;R industry as the CEO of Copeland.</p><p> S : Copeland plays an important role in HVAC&amp;R industry with its technologies: Compressors are the heart of a system, and controls are the brain of a system. In addition, what has been interesting for me is the relationships we have across the industry. We are working with many customers and OEMs to embed our technology to help them advance their solutions. This gives us a broad perspective on how the industry is developing and how we can play a role in contributing to that development.</p>\"}, {'uid': '34205263', 'uid_int': 34205263, 'customerGUID': 'b6150206-d9b1-4963-8907-22b7695c0477', 'url': 'https://my.intelligence2day.com/cc/view/article/?a=3a8fce8e476e943f643dacf760841e1f', 'modified': \"{ts '2025-05-08 18:43:1746729797'}\", 'docHash': '3a8fce8e476e943f643dacf760841e1f', 'AI_category': ['/Business & Industrial'], 'AI_entity_LOCATION': ['Asia Pacific'], 'AI_entity_ORGANIZATION': ['cold chain', 'cold chain', 'Copeland', 'GWP'], 'AI_entity_OTHER': ['perishables', 'pharmaceuticals', 'role', 'imp', 'perishables', 'pharmaceuticals', 'impact', 'demand', 'role', 'technologies', 'refrigerants', 'innovation', 'sector', 'nMichael Toh'], 'AI_entity_PERSON': ['President'], 'AI_sentiment': 0.40000000596, 'AI_meta': ['{\"cold chain\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"perishables\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"pharmaceuticals\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"role\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"imp\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"impact\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"demand\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"technologies\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"refrigerants\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"innovation\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"Asia Pacific\": {\"link\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia\\\\u2013Pacific\", \"mid\": \"/m/055yrc\"}, \"Copeland\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"sector\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"President\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}, \"GWP\": {\"link\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential\", \"mid\": \"/m/03ctz\"}, \"nMichael Toh\": {\"link\": \"\", \"mid\": \"\"}}'], 'key': '/mnt/articles/feed/34205263.xml', 'articletype': '2', 'category': ['external'], 'categorytree': ['8329'], 'usergroupid': '8329', 'custom1': \"{ts '2025-05-08 17:02:30'}\", 'custom2': '34205263', 'dateline': '2025-05-08T17:02:30Z', 'dateentered': \"{ts '2025-05-08 18:43:17'}\", 'dateentered_utc': '2025-05-08T18:43:17Z', 'dateexpire': '2025-08-06T18:43:17Z', 'title': 'The cold chain plays a vital role in preserving perishables and pharmaceuticals, but it also has a significant environmental imp', 'headline': 'The cold chain plays a vital role in preserving perishables and pharmaceuticals, but it also has a significant environmental imp', 'summary': 'The cold chain plays a vital role in preserving perishables and pharmaceuticals, but it also has a significant environmental impact.

of action in the HVAC field with new generation semi-hermetic compressors capable of reaching fluid temperatures up to 135Â°C</p><p> In the current context, transition to more sustainable solutions is increasingly imperative to meet the need to reduce CO\\\\u2082 emissions and strengthen the HVAC industry\\'s independence from fossil sources. In this sense, the goals set by the EU Green Deal , which strives towards climate neutrality by 2050 and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels are ambitious. In this direction, initiatives such as the REPowerEU plan , which is based on the implementation of the proposals of the \"Ready for 55%\" package and the revision of the F-Gas regulation are promoting the adoption of more efficient technologies based on natural refrigerants. As a matter of fact, one of the significant changes concerns the progressive replacement of gas boilers with solutions with less environmental impact, such as high-temperature heat pumps , which guarantee reliable performance, without requiring structural interventions to existing systems. A very interesting opportunity also for process heating , where the demand for sustainable solutions, capable of reaching temperatures above 100Â°C , is constantly increasing , representing a huge potential for a wide range of applications.</p><p> High temperature, low emissions: ATEX-HT is Frascold\\'s answer</p><p> Frascold expands its field of action and meet market needs with the new series of ATEX-HT semi-hermetic piston compressors specifically designed for use with hydrocarbons such as propane (R290), butane and isobutane. The range integrates new generation components for advanced technology , designed to offer high performance in terms of application flexibility, reliability and efficiency . In detail, with regard to versatility , the ATEX-HT series with R290 refrigerant offers the widest range of application , compared to the solutions currently available on the market. As a matter of fact, its wide speed adjustment range allows the compressor to operate at up to 25% of maximum capacity, adapting efficiently to low-load conditions. The reliability and efficiency of the series are the result of an advanced design for use with HC, which provides for the use of components designed to ensure operational continuity and optimised consumption, even in heavy operating conditions. The ability to operate up to the maximum fluid temperature of 135Â°C with butane, 115Â°C with isobutane and 85Â°C with propane , makes of Frascold compressors an ideal natural refrigerant solution to reduce emissions in the heating and air conditioning of medium and large industrial and commercial buildings Integrated in reversible air-water and water-water heat pumps , they are used in healthcare settings such as hospitals, wellness and sports facilities, shopping malls and, above all, in the process industry.</p><p> The technological evolution of the ATEX-HT series focuses on four key elements: engine, valve plates, pistons and oil . In detail, the use of high-efficiency electric motors allows us to exceed seasonal efficiency targets in heating and cooling. In particular, the possibility of using permanent magnet rotors for S-V-Z sizes allows a further increase in performance, equal to 6% on average, which is even more relevant in conditions of high torque and low frequencies. In addition, the higher temperature limits allow to manage a warmer fluid in intake , facilitating operation even in high electrical absorption scenarios. And, again, the design of the valve plates has been optimised in order to withstand the high pressures involved, with differences between delivery and intake of over 30 bar. A further important improvement concerns the pistons , which are characterised by an innovative anti-friction surface treatment designed to reduce friction and wear. A plus that, in addition to raising the resilience of the compressor in heavy and variable plant conditions, facilitates the first start-up , also mitigating the negative effects of any blackouts. Also noteworthy is the choice to use oil with special additives dedicated to use with hydrocarbons , a guarantee of multiple advantages : firstly, it allows to limit the dilution of the refrigerant in the oil , to reduce wear and foaming when the pressure decreases. Secondly, by virtue of its excellent miscibility, thermal stability and lubricating capacity, it promotes the correct flow of oil in the refrigerant circuit which, in addition to improving heat exchange, guarantees an effective return to the ATEX-HT compressor, avoiding the need for regenerative exchangers.</p><p> The ATEX-HT compressor series comes in four sizes \\\\u2013 S, V, Z and W \\\\u2013 each with specific volumetric displacement values and motor power</p><p> S , the most compact one, comes with 4 pistons , with volumetric displacement values ranging from 33 to 56 mÂ³/h and powers between and 15 kW</p><p> V , with 4 models , it reaches 93 mÂ³/h and 24 kW</p><p> Z , equipped with 6 pistons , offers up to 126 mÂ³/h and 30 kW</p><p> W , the most powerful one, comes with 8 pistons , with maximum values of 206 mÂ³/h and 52 kW</p><p> \\\\u201c Frascold was among the first companies to recognise the potential of hydrocarbons for heat pumps and to focus on research and development to transform this intuition into high-performance and reliable solutions \\\\u201d said Livio Calabrese, Sales and Marketing Director at Frascold, who concluded \\\\u201c The new ATEX-HT series is the result of our deep knowledge of the needs of the industry, also stemming from a long direct experience on the ground with customers , a continuous technological progress and strategic vision, which uses sustainable innovation as major competitive asset in order to reduce operating costs and actively contribute to our Customers\\' energy transition. \\\\u201d</p>'}]}\n",

Shuster who assumed the position of Copeland's first chief executive officer (CEO).</p><p> JARN (J): As the top decision-maker at Copeland, what new impetus do you plan to bring to this century-old company?</p><p> Ross</p><p> B. Shuster (S) : We see opportunities to make Copeland even stronger by investing in the growth of the business. People may think Copeland is a company that only produces scroll compressors and is North America centric. However, Copeland is a global company with a wide breadth of products. In fact, nearly half of our revenues come from outside the United States and we have a broad offering of compressors from scroll, to reciprocating, screw, and now centrifugal types. In addition, approximately 20% of our business is in electronics and controls.</p><p> In order to become a stronger company, we are investing in four areas for growth where we see opportunities. These are in the areas of heat pumps, commercial segment products, and industrial segment products areas, as well as in our controls business. Today only about 30% of our business is in the commercial segment, but globally this segment represents nearly half of the global HVAC&amp;R market. Therefore, we are focusing on growing our presence in the commercial market, and the recent release of our oil-free centrifugal compressor is one example of that.</p><p> J: Please tell us the approximate sales breakdown of your current business in the Americas.</p><p> S : In the Americas, we have a broad breadth of technologies that serve the residential air conditioning, commercial air conditioning, refrigeration, and industrial segments. In 2023, we estimate that the residential air conditioning segment accounted for 35% of our Americas business, refrigeration 30%, commercial air conditioning 25%, and industrial 10%. We see growth opportunities in all of them.</p><p> J: Recently, Chinese and South Korean compressor manufacturers launched production in Mexico, etc., targeting the North American market. How do you see this trend as the scroll compressor giant?</p><p> S : We like competition because it drives us to make sure we are investing in research and development (R&amp;D) and in ways to get better. We will spend about 4% of our revenues in R&amp;D and engineering, to ensure we stay ahead of other competitors' developments. In fact, we are already developing the next generation of scroll compressors that will continue to position us a technology leader in this area. In addition, we are aggressively broadening our offerings for different applications, including larger-capacity scroll compressors, screw compressors, semi-hermetic compressors for commercial refrigeration, and oil-free centrifugal compressors.</p><p> J: Could you tell us your new oilfree centrifugal compressor in detail?</p><p> S : At the AHR Expo we are displaying our new oil-free centrifugal compressor. We believe it is highly differentiated because it employs our unique Aero-lift bearing technology, which is engineered to be a worry-free alternative to existing magnetic levitation bearings and refrigerant-lubricated ceramic compression technologies. Compatible with lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, the new oil-free centrifugal compressor is optimized for high-lift performance and higher reliability, efficiency, and serviceability in demanding chiller applications. With these advantages, we think this compressor is well positioned for many applications but particularly for data center applications.</p><p> J:</p><p> When will you start production of this new oil-free compressor?</p><p> S : We have customers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are now piloting this compressor in all parts of the world. Our oilfree compressor is now available in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. We will then expand its production to other locations. We have 26 manufacturing locations around the world, so we can use those existing footprints to accelerate the production.</p><p> J: Where are your important markets globally?</p><p> S : Every market is now offering different opportunities for growth. Even some of the t raditionally smaller markets are growing with different needs. For example, the Canadian market is growing with industrial CO2 cold storage and district heating, and the Latin American market is growing with smaller format refrigeration equipment and controls.</p><p> To meet such respective market needs, we have a global presence with production ability and solutions. In Asia, we own two manufacturing sites, one in Suzhou, China, and one in Thailand. We also have production facilities in India and the Middle East, which are our longterm strong growth markets in addition to Africa. In Europe, we have three manufacturing centers. Europe has become one of our strongest growth markets with the move to electrify heating. Regarding the U.S. market, we see a lot of opportunities to grow because of its large scale.</p><p> J: What are the current trends and challenges in the HVAC&amp;R industry in your opinion, and how does Copeland respond to them as a global leader?</p><p> S : One of the challenges we are facing \\\\u2013 which is also an opportunity \\\\u2013is the varying regional moves to higher energy efficiency regulations and lower GWP refrigerants. Depending upon the part of the world or the industry, the path to lower GWP refrigerants is different. For example, on the refrigeration side, we see a mix of propane (R290), CO2, and A2L refrigerants in both Europe and the United States. However, on the heating and cooling side, the European heat pump market is taking the R290 path, while the U.S. air conditioning market is heading down the path with R454B and R32.</p><p> Therefore, we are investing in all of those possibilities in order to support the different paths which get us to the point of low-GWP refrigerants. As much as 90% of our R&amp;D is directly or indirectly tied to products supporting new refrigerants.</p><p> J: In recent years, there have been many large-scale mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) in the global HVAC&amp;R industry. Are you also interested in M&amp;As?</p><p> S : We are obviously interested in growing organically, but now we also have the ability, and the focus as a standalone company, to invest in M&amp;A to grow inorganically. We would look to invest in areas where we see emerging technologies or where we may have gaps. We also look to invest in local companies where we can help them become more global, leveraging our manufacturing and sales footprint. There are a lot of emerging, but not yet commercialized technologies in the HVAC&amp;R industry. We can work with some of these younger technologies, bringing in our engineering resources to help mature and commercialize them, utilizing our relationships across the industry in order to get those technologies embedded within the industry.</p><p> J: You play an important role in the HVAC&amp;R industry as the CEO of Copeland.</p><p> S : Copeland plays an important role in HVAC&amp;R industry with its technologies: Compressors are the heart of a system, and controls are the brain of a system. In addition, what has been interesting for me is the relationships we have across the industry.

of action in the HVAC field with new generation semi-hermetic compressors capable of reaching fluid temperatures up to 135Â°C</p><p> In the current context, transition to more sustainable solutions is increasingly imperative to meet the need to reduce CO\\\\u2082 emissions and strengthen the HVAC industry\\'s independence from fossil sources. In this sense, the goals set by the EU Green Deal , which strives towards climate neutrality by 2050 and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels are ambitious. In this direction, initiatives such as the REPowerEU plan , which is based on the implementation of the proposals of the \"Ready for 55%\" package and the revision of the F-Gas regulation are promoting the adoption of more efficient technologies based on natural refrigerants. As a matter of fact, one of the significant changes concerns the progressive replacement of gas boilers with solutions with less environmental impact, such as high-temperature heat pumps , which guarantee reliable performance, without requiring structural interventions to existing systems. A very interesting opportunity also for process heating , where the demand for sustainable solutions, capable of reaching temperatures above 100Â°C , is constantly increasing , representing a huge potential for a wide range of applications.</p><p> High temperature, low emissions: ATEX-HT is Frascold\\'s answer</p><p> Frascold expands its field of action and meet market needs with the new series of ATEX-HT semi-hermetic piston compressors specifically designed for use with hydrocarbons such as propane (R290), butane and isobutane. The range integrates new generation components for advanced technology , designed to offer high performance in terms of application flexibility, reliability and efficiency . In detail, with regard to versatility , the ATEX-HT series with R290 refrigerant offers the widest range of application , compared to the solutions currently available on the market. As a matter of fact, its wide speed adjustment range allows the compressor to operate at up to 25% of maximum capacity, adapting efficiently to low-load conditions. The reliability and efficiency of the series are the result of an advanced design for use with HC, which provides for the use of components designed to ensure operational continuity and optimised consumption, even in heavy operating conditions. The ability to operate up to the maximum fluid temperature of 135Â°C with butane, 115Â°C with isobutane and 85Â°C with propane , makes of Frascold compressors an ideal natural refrigerant solution to reduce emissions in the heating and air conditioning of medium and large industrial and commercial buildings Integrated in reversible air-water and water-water heat pumps , they are used in healthcare settings such as hospitals, wellness and sports facilities, shopping malls and, above all, in the process industry.</p><p> The technological evolution of the ATEX-HT series focuses on four key elements: engine, valve plates, pistons and oil . In detail, the use of high-efficiency electric motors allows us to exceed seasonal efficiency targets in heating and cooling. In particular, the possibility of using permanent magnet rotors for S-V-Z sizes allows a further increase in performance, equal to 6% on average, which is even more relevant in conditions of high torque and low frequencies. In addition, the higher temperature limits allow to manage a warmer fluid in intake , facilitating operation even in high electrical absorption scenarios. And, again, the design of the valve plates has been optimised in order to withstand the high pressures involved, with differences between delivery and intake of over 30 bar. A further important improvement concerns the pistons , which are characterised by an innovative anti-friction surface treatment designed to reduce friction and wear. A plus that, in addition to raising the resilience of the compressor in heavy and variable plant conditions, facilitates the first start-up , also mitigating the negative effects of any blackouts. Also noteworthy is the choice to use oil with special additives dedicated to use with hydrocarbons , a guarantee of multiple advantages : firstly, it allows to limit the dilution of the refrigerant in the oil , to reduce wear and foaming when the pressure decreases. Secondly, by virtue of its excellent miscibility, thermal stability and lubricating capacity, it promotes the correct flow of oil in the refrigerant circuit which, in addition to improving heat exchange, guarantees an effective return to the ATEX-HT compressor, avoiding the need for regenerative exchangers.</p><p> The ATEX-HT compressor series comes in four sizes \\\\u2013 S, V, Z and W \\\\u2013 each with specific volumetric displacement values and motor power</p><p> S , the most compact one, comes with 4 pistons , with volumetric displacement values ranging from 33 to 56 mÂ³/h and powers between and 15 kW</p><p> V , with 4 models , it reaches 93 mÂ³/h and 24 kW</p><p> Z , equipped with 6 pistons , offers up to 126 mÂ³/h and 30 kW</p><p> W , the most powerful one, comes with 8 pistons , with maximum values of 206 mÂ³/h and 52 kW</p><p> \\\\u201c Frascold was among the first companies to recognise the potential of hydrocarbons for heat pumps and to focus on research and development to transform this intuition into high-performance and reliable solutions \\\\u201d said Livio Calabrese, Sales and Marketing Director at Frascold, who concluded \\\\u201c The new ATEX-HT series is the result of our deep knowledge of the needs of the industry, also stemming from a long direct experience on the ground with customers , a continuous technological progress and strategic vision, which uses sustainable innovation as major competitive asset in order to reduce operating costs and actively contribute to our Customers\\' energy transition. \\\\u201d</p>'}]}\n",

Shuster who assumed the position of Copeland's first chief executive officer (CEO).</p><p> JARN (J): As the top decision-maker at Copeland, what new impetus do you plan to bring to this century-old company?</p><p> Ross</p><p> B. Shuster (S) : We see opportunities to make Copeland even stronger by investing in the growth of the business. People may think Copeland is a company that only produces scroll compressors and is North America centric. However, Copeland is a global company with a wide breadth of products. In fact, nearly half of our revenues come from outside the United States and we have a broad offering of compressors from scroll, to reciprocating, screw, and now centrifugal types. In addition, approximately 20% of our business is in electronics and controls.</p><p> In order to become a stronger company, we are investing in four areas for growth where we see opportunities. These are in the areas of heat pumps, commercial segment products, and industrial segment products areas, as well as in our controls business. Today only about 30% of our business is in the commercial segment, but globally this segment represents nearly half of the global HVAC&amp;R market. Therefore, we are focusing on growing our presence in the commercial market, and the recent release of our oil-free centrifugal compressor is one example of that.</p><p> J: Please tell us the approximate sales breakdown of your current business in the Americas.</p><p> S : In the Americas, we have a broad breadth of technologies that serve the residential air conditioning, commercial air conditioning, refrigeration, and industrial segments. In 2023, we estimate that the residential air conditioning segment accounted for 35% of our Americas business, refrigeration 30%, commercial air conditioning 25%, and industrial 10%. We see growth opportunities in all of them.</p><p> J: Recently, Chinese and South Korean compressor manufacturers launched production in Mexico, etc., targeting the North American market. How do you see this trend as the scroll compressor giant?</p><p> S : We like competition because it drives us to make sure we are investing in research and development (R&amp;D) and in ways to get better. We will spend about 4% of our revenues in R&amp;D and engineering, to ensure we stay ahead of other competitors' developments. In fact, we are already developing the next generation of scroll compressors that will continue to position us a technology leader in this area. In addition, we are aggressively broadening our offerings for different applications, including larger-capacity scroll compressors, screw compressors, semi-hermetic compressors for commercial refrigeration, and oil-free centrifugal compressors.</p><p> J: Could you tell us your new oilfree centrifugal compressor in detail?</p><p> S : At the AHR Expo we are displaying our new oil-free centrifugal compressor. We believe it is highly differentiated because it employs our unique Aero-lift bearing technology, which is engineered to be a worry-free alternative to existing magnetic levitation bearings and refrigerant-lubricated ceramic compression technologies. Compatible with lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, the new oil-free centrifugal compressor is optimized for high-lift performance and higher reliability, efficiency, and serviceability in demanding chiller applications. With these advantages, we think this compressor is well positioned for many applications but particularly for data center applications.</p><p> J:</p><p> When will you start production of this new oil-free compressor?</p><p> S : We have customers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are now piloting this compressor in all parts of the world. Our oilfree compressor is now available in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. We will then expand its production to other locations. We have 26 manufacturing locations around the world, so we can use those existing footprints to accelerate the production.</p><p> J: Where are your important markets globally?</p><p> S : Every market is now offering different opportunities for growth. Even some of the t raditionally smaller markets are growing with different needs. For example, the Canadian market is growing with industrial CO2 cold storage and district heating, and the Latin American market is growing with smaller format refrigeration equipment and controls.</p><p> To meet such respective market needs, we have a global presence with production ability and solutions. In Asia, we own two manufacturing sites, one in Suzhou, China, and one in Thailand. We also have production facilities in India and the Middle East, which are our longterm strong growth markets in addition to Africa. In Europe, we have three manufacturing centers. Europe has become one of our strongest growth markets with the move to electrify heating. Regarding the U.S. market, we see a lot of opportunities to grow because of its large scale.</p><p> J: What are the current trends and challenges in the HVAC&amp;R industry in your opinion, and how does Copeland respond to them as a global leader?</p><p> S : One of the challenges we are facing \\\\u2013 which is also an opportunity \\\\u2013is the varying regional moves to higher energy efficiency regulations and lower GWP refrigerants. Depending upon the part of the world or the industry, the path to lower GWP refrigerants is different. For example, on the refrigeration side, we see a mix of propane (R290), CO2, and A2L refrigerants in both Europe and the United States. However, on the heating and cooling side, the European heat pump market is taking the R290 path, while the U.S. air conditioning market is heading down the path with R454B and R32.</p><p> Therefore, we are investing in all of those possibilities in order to support the different paths which get us to the point of low-GWP refrigerants. As much as 90% of our R&amp;D is directly or indirectly tied to products supporting new refrigerants.</p><p> J: In recent years, there have been many large-scale mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) in the global HVAC&amp;R industry. Are you also interested in M&amp;As?</p><p> S : We are obviously interested in growing organically, but now we also have the ability, and the focus as a standalone company, to invest in M&amp;A to grow inorganically. We would look to invest in areas where we see emerging technologies or where we may have gaps. We also look to invest in local companies where we can help them become more global, leveraging our manufacturing and sales footprint. There are a lot of emerging, but not yet commercialized technologies in the HVAC&amp;R industry. We can work with some of these younger technologies, bringing in our engineering resources to help mature and commercialize them, utilizing our relationships across the industry in order to get those technologies embedded within the industry.</p><p> J: You play an important role in the HVAC&amp;R industry as the CEO of Copeland.</p><p> S : Copeland plays an important role in HVAC&amp;R industry with its technologies: Compressors are the heart of a system, and controls are the brain of a system. In addition, what has been interesting for me is the relationships we have across the industry. We are working with many customers and OEMs to embed our technology to help them advance their solutions. This gives us a broad perspective on how the industry is developing and how we can play a role in contributing to that development.</p>\"\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> Frascold expands its field of action in the HVAC field with new generation semi-hermetic compressors capable of reaching fluid temperatures up to 135\\u00b0C</p><p> In the current context, transition to more sustainable solutions is increasingly imperative to meet the need to reduce CO\\\\u2082 emissions and strengthen the HVAC industry's independence from fossil sources. In this sense, the goals set by the EU Green Deal , which strives towards climate neutrality by 2050 and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels are ambitious. In this direction, initiatives such as the REPowerEU plan , which is based on the implementation of the proposals of the \\\"Ready for 55%\\\" package and the revision of the F-Gas regulation are promoting the adoption of more efficient technologies based on natural refrigerants. As a matter of fact, one of the significant changes concerns the progressive replacement of gas boilers with solutions with less environmental impact, such as high-temperature heat pumps , which guarantee reliable performance, without requiring structural interventions to existing systems. A very interesting opportunity also for process heating , where the demand for sustainable solutions, capable of reaching temperatures above 100\\u00b0C , is constantly increasing , representing a huge potential for a wide range of applications.</p><p> High temperature, low emissions: ATEX-HT is Frascold's answer</p><p> Frascold expands its field of action and meet market needs with the new series of ATEX-HT semi-hermetic piston compressors specifically designed for use with hydrocarbons such as propane (R290), butane and isobutane. The range integrates new generation components for advanced technology , designed to offer high performance in terms of application flexibility, reliability and efficiency . In detail, with regard to versatility , the ATEX-HT series with R290 refrigerant offers the widest range of application , compared to the solutions currently available on the market. As a matter of fact, its wide speed adjustment range allows the compressor to operate at up to 25% of maximum capacity, adapting efficiently to low-load conditions. The reliability and efficiency of the series are the result of an advanced design for use with HC, which provides for the use of components designed to ensure operational continuity and optimised consumption, even in heavy operating conditions. The ability to operate up to the maximum fluid temperature of 135\\u00b0C with butane, 115\\u00b0C with isobutane and 85\\u00b0C with propane , makes of Frascold compressors an ideal natural refrigerant solution to reduce emissions in the heating and air conditioning of medium and large industrial and commercial buildings Integrated in reversible air-water and water-water heat pumps , they are used in healthcare settings such as hospitals, wellness and sports facilities, shopping malls and, above all, in the process industry.</p><p> The technological evolution of the ATEX-HT series focuses on four key elements: engine, valve plates, pistons and oil . In detail, the use of high-efficiency electric motors allows us to exceed seasonal efficiency targets in heating and cooling. In particular, the possibility of using permanent magnet rotors for S-V-Z sizes allows a further increase in performance, equal to 6% on average, which is even more relevant in conditions of high torque and low frequencies. In addition, the higher temperature limits allow to manage a warmer fluid in intake , facilitating operation even in high electrical absorption scenarios. And, again, the design of the valve plates has been optimised in order to withstand the high pressures involved, with differences between delivery and intake of over 30 bar. A further important improvement concerns the pistons , which are characterised by an innovative anti-friction surface treatment designed to reduce friction and wear. A plus that, in addition to raising the resilience of the compressor in heavy and variable plant conditions, facilitates the first start-up , also mitigating the negative effects of any blackouts. Also noteworthy is the choice to use oil with special additives dedicated to use with hydrocarbons , a guarantee of multiple advantages : firstly, it allows to limit the dilution of the refrigerant in the oil , to reduce wear and foaming when the pressure decreases. Secondly, by virtue of its excellent miscibility, thermal stability and lubricating capacity, it promotes the correct flow of oil in the refrigerant circuit which, in addition to improving heat exchange, guarantees an effective return to the ATEX-HT compressor, avoiding the need for regenerative exchangers.</p><p> The ATEX-HT compressor series comes in four sizes \\\\u2013 S, V, Z and W \\\\u2013 each with specific volumetric displacement values and motor power</p><p> S , the most compact one, comes with 4 pistons , with volumetric displacement values ranging from 33 to 56 m\\u00b3/h and powers between and 15 kW</p><p> V , with 4 models , it reaches 93 m\\u00b3/h and 24 kW</p><p> Z , equipped with 6 pistons , offers up to 126 m\\u00b3/h and 30 kW</p><p> W , the most powerful one, comes with 8 pistons , with maximum values of 206 m\\u00b3/h and 52 kW</p><p> \\\\u201c Frascold was among the first companies to recognise the potential of hydrocarbons for heat pumps and to focus on research and development to transform this intuition into high-performance and reliable solutions \\\\u201d said Livio Calabrese, Sales and Marketing Director at Frascold, who concluded \\\\u201c The new ATEX-HT series is the result of our deep knowledge of the needs of the industry, also stemming from a long direct experience on the ground with customers , a continuous technological progress and strategic vision, which uses sustainable innovation as major competitive asset in order to reduce operating costs and actively contribute to our Customers' energy transition. \\\\u201d</p>\"\n",
