The containers, known as reefers, are available in 20-foot (6.1-meter) and 40-foot (12.2-meter) sizes and can be used either grounded or on chassis, depending on operational needs.</p><p> SeaCube Cold Solutions is built on the company\\'s experience in refrigerated intermodal leasing and aims to meet rising demand for scalable and energy-efficient cold storage. Its containers maintain temperatures ranging from -20Â°F to 80Â°F (-29Â°C to 27Â°C), allowing for safe storage of meat, seafood, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and flowers.</p><p> \"SeaCube\\'s vast fleet size and nationwide coverage allow us to offer unparalleled flexibility and peace of mind to our clients. We are proud to provide businesses with the ease of working with a single trusted company, no matter where they need their reefers,\" said Bob Sappio, CEO at SeaCube Containers.</p><p> The containers are USDA-compliant and built with insulated stainless steel and aluminum interiors.
