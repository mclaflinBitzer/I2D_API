In addition, in order to provide a concrete, greener alternative to traditional refrigerants, WSM3-G07 has been specifically designed for R32 refrigerant. The reduced GWP of this refrigerant has a positive impact on both direct and indirect global warming, therefore representing the ideal choice even for the most sustainable installations.

Furthermore, Johnson Controls highlighted the importance of hybrid and liquid cooling solutions for handling high-density compute chips in data centers. As rack density increases, particularly above 80 kilowatts, cooling the GPU with air alone becomes ineffective, necessitating liquid cooling. They highlighted single-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling as the current standard but noted the need for airflow to cool other electrical components within the server. Johnson Controls also mentioned the potential for two-phase refrigerant-based cooling methods to handle higher demand density requirements in the future.\n",

This comprehensive approach is essential for driving decarbonization efforts forward and avoiding being solely a component supplier, enabling the company to bring more innovative solutions to the market. In summary, Kristian Strand highlights the importance of the company&rsquo;s role in leveraging its knowledge of various components to create optimized systems and drive decarbonization efforts.

Copeland\\\\u2019s innovative Vilter single-screw compression technology has proven to be up to the task, delivering superior performance and unmatched reliability in the most demanding industrial environments.Its legendary reliability comes from a design centered on balanced forces exerting minimal loads on bearings and other key components. And precision and efficiency come with a unique parallel slide valve technology, enabling optimum efficiency through the full range of capacity. from full load down to 20 percent, it adapts effortlessly to diverse industrial needs. This means the cost of a VFD is not needed to achieve optimum efficiency for part load requirements. But seeing is believing. Our new video demonstrates how Vilter single-screw technology redefines industrial efficiency and reliability, lowering maintenance and operational costs.Watch now: <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ow.ly/71oj50VZmLv?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_self\"> https://ow.ly/71oj50VZmLv </a> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/signup?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Findustrialrefrigeration&amp;trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text\" target=\"_self\"> #IndustrialRefrigeration </a> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/signup?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fviltercompression&amp;trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text\" target=\"_self\"> #VilterCompression </a> </div></div>', 'attachmenturl': 'https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333885283546943490', 'sourcemetadata': ' , Vilter by Copeland', 'source': 'Bitzer', 'sourceFacet': 'Bitzer', 'provider': 'LinkedIn Monitor', 'provider_id': 'A2138462-899E-4D2B-9E90D2227E3C882B', 'articleState': '0', 'topic': 'Company, Business Topics|Capacity, Company|Key Competitors, Business Topics|Technology, Business Topics|Innovation, Company|Key Competitors|Copeland, Information type|LinkedIn, Business Topics', 'topicId': ['138698', '138703', '133091', '135576', '133036', '133101', '133040', '135578', '135575'], 'topicFacet': ['133040^Innovation', '133091^Capacity', '133101^Technology', '135576^Key Competitors', '135578^Copeland', '138698^LinkedIn'], 'topicFeedFacet': ['138703^LinkedIn Monitor'], 'topicRootFacet': ['133036^Business Topics', '135575^Company'], 'images': ['<img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQFAe79mzsYR8A/image-shrink_1280/B4EZccxzd3HkAY-/0/1748534508198?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=StDTBVyYy0dV_5mM00JszX0aFXqRRX_5WI3x_qQfqdc\">'], 'comments': '0', 'comments_int': 0, 'likescounter': 0, 'likescounter_int': 0, 'reads': 0, '_version_': 1833473868767952896, 'last_indexed': '2025-05-29T16:42:18.444Z'}]}\n",
