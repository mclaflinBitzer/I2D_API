      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> Danfoss supplies Editron motors and D1P pumps for SANY's 80- to 150-tonne cranes. For its 200-tonne platform, SANY opted for an integrated Danfoss eHydraulic Power Module to power the traction and work function systems. Comprising an Editron PMI375-T1100 motor and D1P 260-cc pump, the system is optimized to deliver peak performance and maximize hydraulic system efficiency, extending machine runtime on a single charge. The full hydraulics system also includes a Danfoss Series 90 pump and PVG 128 valve.</p><p> SANY realized additional benefits with the Danfoss eHydraulic Power Module, including a compact package with mechanical advantages, simple installation, and high reliability. Supplying the electric motor and hydraulic pump as an integrated package eliminates the risk of noise, vibration, and component damage that can arise when using a flexible coupling to join the components. It also simplifies and accelerates installation as there's no need for the OEM to connect the components. CE marks and Danfoss' global service network were also key reasons SANY chose to partner with Danfoss on the project.</p><p> \\\\u201cBuilding a solution for SANY's high-capacity platform with the Danfoss integrated eHydraulic Power Module marks a milestone,\\\\u201d said Roy Chen, President, Editron division, Danfoss Power Solutions. \\\\u201ceHydraulics represents the future. Together with our Controls division, we have designed a system combining our D1P pump and Editron motor while tuning controls algorithms to maximize efficiency. We look forward to our continued collaboration with SANY and supporting their green journey.\\\\u201d</p><p> \\\\u201cConventional hydraulics still plays a role in the electrification of heavy machinery, particularly machines of this size,\\\\u201d said Henrik J\\u00f8rgensen, President, Controls division, Danfoss Power Solutions. \\\\u201cBy integrating Danfoss' advanced hydraulic solutions and electrification technology, we are empowering a smooth transition to more sustainable operations. Leveraging our eHydraulic solutions and our application know-how, we aspire to be the partner of choice for visionary OEMs like SANY.\\\\u201d</p><p> To learn more about Danfoss solutions for electrification, visit Danfoss.com/Editron</p>\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \" Danfoss Sensing Solutions has introduced the DST G290 Gas Sensor series for use in HVAC and commercial refrigeration systems operating with propane (R290) refrigerant.\",\n",
      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> The new sensors utilize photoacoustic (PA) technology and a patented inverted design to support accurate and reliable leak detection in harsh environments.</p><p> Unlike conventional infrared (IR)-only sensors, the DST G290 combines IR light and acoustic sensing to enhance selectivity and detection accuracy. The IR source emits light at wavelengths specific to propane molecules. These vibrations generate sound waves, which are detected by an integrated microphone. The system filters out unrelated sound frequencies, improving precision.</p><p> The sensors operate across a temperature range of -40 to 80 degrees Celsius (-40 to 176 degrees Fahrenheit) and humidity range of 0 to 100 percent. According to Danfoss, the DST G290 has a response time of under 30 seconds and a 6-second warm-up time. The PA design does not require additional heaters, contributing to energy efficiency.</p><p> To withstand challenging installation conditions, the sensors feature a patented inverted design that shields internal components from dust, water spray, and oil. A semi-permeable membrane permits target gases while blocking contaminants. The enclosure materials are resistant to ultraviolet exposure and degradation from common household chemicals.</p><p> The DST G290 series includes integrated diagnostics and is designed to meet IEC 60335-2-40 requirements. It is certified by a third-party body to IEC standards, and the relay is ATEX compliant.</p><p> \\\\u201cBecause propane is highly flammable, the A3 gas sensors must be highly selective to perform at the highest level,\\\\u201d said Iro Dragoumi, Segment Manager, HVAC&amp;R, Danfoss Sensing Solutions. \\\\u201cWith the DST G290 Gas Sensor series, we've addressed these concerns by developing a sensor that offers fast, accurate leak detection, minimizes the risk of false alarms and ensures reliable performance in the harshest of environments.\\\\u201d</p>\",\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> Photoacoustic technology enables highly selective propane leak detection</p><p> While most gas sensing products currently on the market rely only on infrared (IR) light absorption measurements to detect propane molecules, the DST G290 by Danfoss Sensing Solutions combines both light and sound \\\\u2013 photo + acoustic \\\\u2013 sensing methods to achieve highly selective leak detection. \\\\u201cPhotoacoustic (PA) technology operates based on the principle that gas molecules absorb IR light producing specific wavelengths, due to their unique molecular structure,\\\\u201d explains Iro. \\\\u201cThis characteristic makes PA sensors exceptionally selective, allowing for precise detection of the target gas, in this case, propane.\\\\u201d</p><p> The sensor is designed to ensure that only gas can enter the chamber, while filtering out external factors, such as dust and other particles and liquids. It also contains an IR light source that only emits light at wavelengths absorbed by propane molecules. This tuned IR light source causes the propane molecules to vibrate. By modulating the light source, sound waves are generated and measured by the sensor's built-in microphone. It also uses a sound filtering technique to block other sound frequencies, thus increasing the level of leak detection accuracy.</p><p> \\\\u201cBy using both light and sound, PA technology combines molecular absorption physics, thermal dynamics and acoustic signal processing to deliver high accuracy, sensitivity and selectivity in propane gas detection,\\\\u201d explains Iro.</p><p> PA technology offers other advantages as well. \\\\u201cPA technology doesn't require extra heaters, making it a more energy-efficient alternative to other gas sensing technologies. It covers a temperature range of -40 to 80 degrees Celsius and the full humidity range of 0 to 100.\\\\u201d Photoacoustic sensors offer unparalleled stability and reliability, making them the ideal choice for environments with fluctuating temperatures and humidity levels. The DST G290 sensors also have a response time of less than 30 seconds and a warm-up time of 6 seconds, further ensuring that leaks are detected as quickly as possible.</p><p> Focusing on system reliability and robustness</p><p> When designing the DST G290 Gas Sensor series, the Danfoss Sensing Solutions team wanted to provide customers with a reliable, robust sensor that could last for 15 years or more. \\\\u201cOur customers install sensors in harsh environments, where elements like humidity, dust, oil spray and ultraviolet light can impact sensor performance,\\\\u201d says Iro. \\\\u201cSo, the DST G290 features our patented inverted design that protects the membrane from these elements.\\\\u201d</p><p> The sensor's unique, patented positioning leverages the diffusion flow principle, ensuring that it's unaffected by oil, dust and water spray. Sensor materials are resistant to prolonged UV exposure, and the sensor is resilient to other gases, including common household chemicals, so it performs consistently without degradation over time. \\\\u201cWe've also encapsulated the sensor core within a semi-permeable membrane that allows necessary gases to pass through while blocking harmful substances. This membrane is instrumental in guaranteeing the sensor's continuous, error-free operation for more than 15 years, significantly reducing the need for maintenance or replacements.\\\\u201d</p><p> As an additional enhancement to system reliability, the sensor also includes a full signal chain diagnostics system that continuously checks for faults or errors. The Danfoss Sensing Solutions team specifically engineered the DST G290 series to meet IEC 60335-2-40 requirements, and the sensors are IEC third-party certified, and its relay is ATEX compliant.</p><p> By offering a gas sensor specifically designed and certified to work with A3 refrigerants, Danfoss Sensing Solutions offers customers much-needed peace of mind in a rapidly changing industry. \\\\u201cEvery transition is accompanied with a degree of uncertainty. Our customers are navigating in unfamiliar territory as they look for proven, reliable technology that can ensure the safe use of propane refrigerants in HVAC/R installations. With the DST G290 Gas Sensor series, we've addressed these concerns by developing a sensor that offers fast, accurate leak detection, minimizes the risk of false alarms and ensures reliable performance in the harshest of environments. And by producing it in Europe, we make certain that our customers benefit from a resilient supply chain with local suppliers,\\\\u201d concludes Iro.</p><p> Related products</p>\"\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> Copeland has announced it is expanding its partnership with Mysa in the U.S. after successfully adding Mysa products to its portfolio in the Canadian market . This will complement Copeland's growing Sensi portfolio of smart, sustainable thermostats. While Copeland's Sensi smart thermostats offer solutions for conventional HVAC and heat pump systems, Mysa enables homeowners in the U.S. who have in-floor, mini-split and baseboard heating systems to also access energy savings and sustainability benefits.</p><p> The partnership, which expands Mysa's availability to the U.S. wholesale market, allows Mysa to leverage Copeland's established national HVACR and electrical distribution network, its proximity to customers, and its world-class approach to customer service to bring Mysa's technology to contractors serving all different heating systems in the U.S.</p><p> \\\\u201cBaseboard heating systems are commonly used in the U.S., particularly in older homes, so adding Mysa products to our smart thermostat portfolio allows us to provide more people with smart, sustainable thermostat solutions,\\\\u201d said Brendan O'Toole, vice-president smart home and energy management for Copeland. \\\\u201cCopeland has a legacy of creating innovative climate solutions that provide real tangible value to our customers, bringing to the market products that promote sustainability and energy efficiency. When we introduce climate-friendly products into more homes, we're improving lives and protecting the planet. This partnership allows us to drive more impact, together.\\\\u201d</p><p> Copeland's line of Sensi smart thermostats remains vital for energy conservation and sustainability, saving users about 23% on HVAC energy consumption. There are over 23 million smart thermostats by Copeland in U.S. homes and buildings. These devices can be leveraged in utility demand response programs to reduce energy usage during periods of peak demand, enabling more renewable energy to be added to the grid and supporting Copeland's net-zero carbon emission goals.</p><p> Mysa smart thermostats provide homeowners with baseboard heating systems the tools to monitor energy usage and estimate heating costs. The units allow complete control over thermostat settings and provide automatic alerts if home temperatures drift outside a specified range. Similarly, the Sensi mobile app also offers advanced control features, enabling users to manage heating and cooling systems with ease. Both Mysa and Sensi thermostats are compatible with various smart home ecosystems, offering streamlined integration for enhanced functionality.</p><p> \\\\u201cSince our story began in 2016, our smart thermostats have saved more than 150 million kilowatt hours of home energy \\\\u2013 enough to power 10,000 homes for a full year*,\\\\u201d said Josh Green, CEO of Mysa. \\\\u201cBy expanding into the U.S. market in partnership with Copeland, we're amplifying our ability to fight climate change on a much bigger scale \\\\u2013 one smart thermostat at a time.\\\\u201d</p><p> www.copeland.com</p>\",\n",

The partnership enables Mysa to access Copeland's U.S. wholesale HVACR and electrical distribution network, extending its reach to contractors serving homes with these specific heating systems.</p><p> According to Copeland, baseboard heating is still commonly used in many older U.S. homes, making the addition of Mysa products a strategic complement to its existing lineup. The Sensi portfolio currently includes over 23 million installed smart thermostats across the U.S., and has been shown to reduce HVAC energy consumption by approximately 23%. These devices can also be integrated into utility demand response programs.</p><p> Mysa thermostats offer features such as real-time energy usage monitoring, estimated heating cost tracking, and automated temperature alerts. Both Mysa and Sensi systems are compatible with major smart home platforms and allow users to manage settings remotely through mobile apps.</p><p> \\\\u201cBaseboard heating systems are commonly used in the U.S., particularly in older homes, so adding Mysa products to our smart thermostat portfolio allows us to provide more people with smart, sustainable thermostat solutions,\\\\u201d said Brendan O'Toole, vice-president smart home and energy management for Copeland.</p><p> \\\\u201cBy expanding into the U.S. market in partnership with Copeland, we're amplifying our ability to fight climate change on a much bigger scale \\\\u2013 one smart thermostat at a time,\\\\u201d said Josh Green, CEO of Mysa.</p>\",\n",

This will complement Copeland's growing Sensi portfolio of smart, sustainable thermostats. While Copeland's Sensi smart thermostats offer solutions for conventional HVAC and heat pump systems, Mysa enables homeowners in the U.S. who have in-floor, mini-split and baseboard heating systems to also access energy savings and sustainability benefits.</p><p> The partnership, which expands Mysa's availability to the U.S. wholesale market, allows Mysa to leverage Copeland's established national HVACR and electrical distribution network, its proximity to customers, and its world-class approach to customer service to bring Mysa's technology to contractors serving all different heating systems in the U.S.</p><p> \\\\u201cBaseboard heating systems are commonly used in the U.S., particularly in older homes, so adding Mysa products to our smart thermostat portfolio allows us to provide more people with smart, sustainable thermostat solutions,\\\\u201d said Brendan O'Toole, vice-president smart home and energy management for Copeland. \\\\u201cCopeland has a legacy of creating innovative climate solutions that provide real tangible value to our customers, bringing to the market products that promote sustainability and energy efficiency. When we introduce climate-friendly products into more homes, we're improving lives and protecting the planet. This partnership allows us to drive more impact, together.\\\\u201d</p><p> Copeland's line of Sensi smart thermostats remains vital for energy conservation and sustainability, saving users about 23% on HVAC energy consumption. There are over 23 million smart thermostats by Copeland in U.S. homes and buildings. These devices can be leveraged in utility demand response programs to reduce energy usage during periods of peak demand, enabling more renewable energy to be added to the grid and supporting Copeland's net-zero carbon emission goals.</p><p> Mysa smart thermostats provide homeowners with baseboard heating systems the tools to monitor energy usage and estimate heating costs. The units allow complete control over thermostat settings and provide automatic alerts if home temperatures drift outside a specified range. Similarly, the Sensi mobile app also offers advanced control features, enabling users to manage heating and cooling systems with ease. Both Mysa and Sensi thermostats are compatible with various smart home ecosystems, offering streamlined integration for enhanced functionality.</p><p> \\\\u201cSince our story began in 2016, our smart thermostats have saved more than 150 million kilowatt hours of home energy \\\\u2013 enough to power 10,000 homes for a full year*,\\\\u201d said Josh Green, CEO of Mysa. \\\\u201cBy expanding into the U.S. market in partnership with Copeland, we're amplifying our ability to fight climate change on a much bigger scale \\\\u2013 one smart thermostat at a time.\\\\u201d</p><p> Learn more about Copeland's sustainable solutions at Copeland.com .

F\\u00fcr Anwender sind die komplexen Anforderungen jedoch oft nur schwer zu erfassen. Im Danfoss InTalk am 3.

Auch wenn unver\\u00e4ndert Kritikpunkte bleiben, gilt das Gesetz insbesondere unter Experten als Meilenstein auf dem Weg zu einer Senkung der CO -Emissionen von Geb\\u00e4uden. Die Komplexit\\u00e4t der gesetzlichen Vorgaben allerdings bereitet vielen Anwendern noch immer Schwierigkeiten und hat inzwischen auch in der Politik den Ruf nach einer Vereinfachung der Regelungen laut werden lassen. Ob \\\\u2013 und wenn ja, bis wann \\\\u2013 solche Vereinfachungen tats\\u00e4chlich umgesetzt werden, ist Stand heute indes noch offen.</p><p> Vor diesem Hintergrund bem\\u00fchen sich im Danfoss Live Online-Event \\\\u201eRETHINK Live InTalk GEG 2025\\\\u201c von 11:00 bis 12:30 Uhr drei ausgewiesene Geb\\u00e4udetechnik-Spezialisten um eine Beantwortung der wichtigsten Fragen rund um das novellierte Gesetz. Unter dem Motto \\\\u201eGEG-konform in die Zukunft \\\\u2013 Experten im Gespr\\u00e4ch\\\\u201c diskutieren Dr. Peter Hug, Gesch\\u00e4ftsf\\u00fchrer des Fachverbandes Automation und Management f\\u00fcr Haus und Geb\\u00e4ude im VDMA, Dr.-Ing. Johannes Peter F\\u00fctterer, Gr\\u00fcnder und CEO der Aedifion GmbH sowie Christoph Adams B.A., Key Account Manager \\\\u2013 Building Automation bei Danfoss \\u00fcber die neuen gesetzlichen Anforderungen und stellen praxisnahe L\\u00f6sungen f\\u00fcr den Arbeitsalltag vor. Ein besonderes Augenmerk gilt der intelligenten Geb\\u00e4udeautomation, deren Realisierung in \\u00a7 71a GEG z. T. sogar erstmals zur Vorschrift erhoben worden ist und die auch \\u00fcber das GEG hinaus als effektivster und zukunftstr\\u00e4chtigster Weg zur Optimierung der Geb\\u00e4udeenergieeffizienz betrachtet werden kann.</p><p> <h> Best Practices aus beispielhaften Anwendungsf\\u00e4llen </h> Im Rahmen des Live Online-Events erhalten die Zuschauer detaillierte Infos dar\\u00fcber, wie sie die komplexen Anforderungen des neuen GEG einfach und effektiv erf\\u00fcllen k\\u00f6nnen \\\\u2013 mit dem Ergebnis, dass durch die Steigerung der Geb\\u00e4udeenergieeffizienz sowohl CO2-Emissionen als auch Betriebskosten dauerhaft sinken. Der Beitrag, den dabei insbesondere eine intelligente Geb\\u00e4udeautomation leistet, wird durch Best Practices aus beispielhaften Anwendungsf\\u00e4llen erl\\u00e4utert. Zudem gibt es Tipps zum Austausch mit Branchenexperten und zur gezielten Erweiterung des eigenen Netzwerks.</p><p> Die Teilnahme am Danfoss \\\\u201eRETHINK Live InTalk GEG 2025\\\\u201c ist kostenfrei, erfordert aber eine Anmeldung.

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> During 2024 AHR Expo held in Chicago in January, JARN visited Copeland's booth and interviewed Ross B. Shuster who assumed the position of Copeland's first chief executive officer (CEO).</p><p> JARN (J): As the top decision-maker at Copeland, what new impetus do you plan to bring to this century-old company?</p><p> Ross</p><p> B. Shuster (S) : We see opportunities to make Copeland even stronger by investing in the growth of the business. People may think Copeland is a company that only produces scroll compressors and is North America centric. However, Copeland is a global company with a wide breadth of products. In fact, nearly half of our revenues come from outside the United States and we have a broad offering of compressors from scroll, to reciprocating, screw, and now centrifugal types. In addition, approximately 20% of our business is in electronics and controls.</p><p> In order to become a stronger company, we are investing in four areas for growth where we see opportunities. These are in the areas of heat pumps, commercial segment products, and industrial segment products areas, as well as in our controls business. Today only about 30% of our business is in the commercial segment, but globally this segment represents nearly half of the global HVAC&amp;R market. Therefore, we are focusing on growing our presence in the commercial market, and the recent release of our oil-free centrifugal compressor is one example of that.</p><p> J: Please tell us the approximate sales breakdown of your current business in the Americas.</p><p> S : In the Americas, we have a broad breadth of technologies that serve the residential air conditioning, commercial air conditioning, refrigeration, and industrial segments. In 2023, we estimate that the residential air conditioning segment accounted for 35% of our Americas business, refrigeration 30%, commercial air conditioning 25%, and industrial 10%. We see growth opportunities in all of them.</p><p> J: Recently, Chinese and South Korean compressor manufacturers launched production in Mexico, etc., targeting the North American market. How do you see this trend as the scroll compressor giant?</p><p> S : We like competition because it drives us to make sure we are investing in research and development (R&amp;D) and in ways to get better. We will spend about 4% of our revenues in R&amp;D and engineering, to ensure we stay ahead of other competitors' developments. In fact, we are already developing the next generation of scroll compressors that will continue to position us a technology leader in this area. In addition, we are aggressively broadening our offerings for different applications, including larger-capacity scroll compressors, screw compressors, semi-hermetic compressors for commercial refrigeration, and oil-free centrifugal compressors.</p><p> J: Could you tell us your new oilfree centrifugal compressor in detail?</p><p> S : At the AHR Expo we are displaying our new oil-free centrifugal compressor. We believe it is highly differentiated because it employs our unique Aero-lift bearing technology, which is engineered to be a worry-free alternative to existing magnetic levitation bearings and refrigerant-lubricated ceramic compression technologies. Compatible with lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, the new oil-free centrifugal compressor is optimized for high-lift performance and higher reliability, efficiency, and serviceability in demanding chiller applications. With these advantages, we think this compressor is well positioned for many applications but particularly for data center applications.</p><p> J:</p><p> When will you start production of this new oil-free compressor?</p><p> S : We have customers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are now piloting this compressor in all parts of the world. Our oilfree compressor is now available in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. We will then expand its production to other locations. We have 26 manufacturing locations around the world, so we can use those existing footprints to accelerate the production.</p><p> J: Where are your important markets globally?</p><p> S : Every market is now offering different opportunities for growth. Even some of the t raditionally smaller markets are growing with different needs. For example, the Canadian market is growing with industrial CO2 cold storage and district heating, and the Latin American market is growing with smaller format refrigeration equipment and controls.</p><p> To meet such respective market needs, we have a global presence with production ability and solutions. In Asia, we own two manufacturing sites, one in Suzhou, China, and one in Thailand. We also have production facilities in India and the Middle East, which are our longterm strong growth markets in addition to Africa. In Europe, we have three manufacturing centers. Europe has become one of our strongest growth markets with the move to electrify heating. Regarding the U.S. market, we see a lot of opportunities to grow because of its large scale.</p><p> J: What are the current trends and challenges in the HVAC&amp;R industry in your opinion, and how does Copeland respond to them as a global leader?</p><p> S : One of the challenges we are facing \\\\u2013 which is also an opportunity \\\\u2013is the varying regional moves to higher energy efficiency regulations and lower GWP refrigerants. Depending upon the part of the world or the industry, the path to lower GWP refrigerants is different. For example, on the refrigeration side, we see a mix of propane (R290), CO2, and A2L refrigerants in both Europe and the United States. However, on the heating and cooling side, the European heat pump market is taking the R290 path, while the U.S. air conditioning market is heading down the path with R454B and R32.</p><p> Therefore, we are investing in all of those possibilities in order to support the different paths which get us to the point of low-GWP refrigerants. As much as 90% of our R&amp;D is directly or indirectly tied to products supporting new refrigerants.</p><p> J: In recent years, there have been many large-scale mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) in the global HVAC&amp;R industry. Are you also interested in M&amp;As?</p><p> S : We are obviously interested in growing organically, but now we also have the ability, and the focus as a standalone company, to invest in M&amp;A to grow inorganically. We would look to invest in areas where we see emerging technologies or where we may have gaps. We also look to invest in local companies where we can help them become more global, leveraging our manufacturing and sales footprint. There are a lot of emerging, but not yet commercialized technologies in the HVAC&amp;R industry. We can work with some of these younger technologies, bringing in our engineering resources to help mature and commercialize them, utilizing our relationships across the industry in order to get those technologies embedded within the industry.</p><p> J: You play an important role in the HVAC&amp;R industry as the CEO of Copeland.</p><p> S : Copeland plays an important role in HVAC&amp;R industry with its technologies: Compressors are the heart of a system, and controls are the brain of a system. In addition, what has been interesting for me is the relationships we have across the industry. We are working with many customers and OEMs to embed our technology to help them advance their solutions. This gives us a broad perspective on how the industry is developing and how we can play a role in contributing to that development.</p>\"\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p>Frascold expands its field of action in the HVAC field with new generation semi-hermetic compressors capable of reaching fluid temperatures up to 135&deg;C</p><p>In the current context, transition to more sustainable solutions is increasingly imperative to meet the need to reduce CO\\\\u2082 emissions and strengthen the HVAC industry&#39;s independence from fossil sources. In this sense, the goals set by the EU Green Deal , which strives towards climate neutrality by 2050 and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels are ambitious. In this direction, initiatives such as the REPowerEU plan , which is based on the implementation of the proposals of the &quot;Ready for 55%&quot; package and the revision of the F-Gas regulation are promoting the adoption of more efficient technologies based on natural refrigerants. As a matter of fact, one of the significant changes concerns the progressive replacement of gas boilers with solutions with less environmental impact, such as high-temperature heat pumps , which guarantee reliable performance, without requiring structural interventions to existing systems. A very interesting opportunity also for process heating , where the demand for sustainable solutions, capable of reaching temperatures above 100&deg;C , is constantly increasing , representing a huge potential for a wide range of applications.</p><p>High temperature, low emissions: ATEX-HT is Frascold&#39;s answer</p><p>Frascold expands its field of action and meet market needs with the new series of ATEX-HT semi-hermetic piston compressors specifically designed for use with hydrocarbons such as propane (R290), butane and isobutane. The range integrates new generation components for advanced technology , designed to offer high performance in terms of application flexibility, reliability and efficiency . In detail, with regard to versatility , the ATEX-HT series with R290 refrigerant offers the widest range of application , compared to the solutions currently available on the market. As a matter of fact, its wide speed adjustment range allows the compressor to operate at up to 25% of maximum capacity, adapting efficiently to low-load conditions. The reliability and efficiency of the series are the result of an advanced design for use with HC, which provides for the use of components designed to ensure operational continuity and optimised consumption, even in heavy operating conditions. The ability to operate up to the maximum fluid temperature of 135&deg;C with butane, 115&deg;C with isobutane and 85&deg;C with propane , makes of Frascold compressors an ideal natural refrigerant solution to reduce emissions in the heating and air conditioning of medium and large industrial and commercial buildings Integrated in reversible air-water and water-water heat pumps , they are used in healthcare settings such as hospitals, wellness and sports facilities, shopping malls and, above all, in the process industry.</p><p>The technological evolution of the ATEX-HT series focuses on four key elements: engine, valve plates, pistons and oil . In detail, the use of high-efficiency electric motors allows us to exceed seasonal efficiency targets in heating and cooling. In particular, the possibility of using permanent magnet rotors for S-V-Z sizes allows a further increase in performance, equal to 6% on average, which is even more relevant in conditions of high torque and low frequencies. In addition, the higher temperature limits allow to manage a warmer fluid in intake , facilitating operation even in high electrical absorption scenarios. And, again, the design of the valve plates has been optimised in order to withstand the high pressures involved, with differences between delivery and intake of over 30 bar. A further important improvement concerns the pistons , which are characterised by an innovative anti-friction surface treatment designed to reduce friction and wear. A plus that, in addition to raising the resilience of the compressor in heavy and variable plant conditions, facilitates the first start-up , also mitigating the negative effects of any blackouts. Also noteworthy is the choice to use oil with special additives dedicated to use with hydrocarbons , a guarantee of multiple advantages : firstly, it allows to limit the dilution of the refrigerant in the oil , to reduce wear and foaming when the pressure decreases. Secondly, by virtue of its excellent miscibility, thermal stability and lubricating capacity, it promotes the correct flow of oil in the refrigerant circuit which, in addition to improving heat exchange, guarantees an effective return to the ATEX-HT compressor, avoiding the need for regenerative exchangers.</p><p>The ATEX-HT compressor series comes in four sizes &ndash; S, V, Z and W &ndash; each with specific volumetric displacement values and motor power</p><p>S , the most compact one, comes with 4 pistons , with volumetric displacement values ranging from 33 to 56 m&sup3;/h and powers between and 15 kW</p><p>V , with 4 models , it reaches 93 m&sup3;/h and 24 kW</p><p>Z , equipped with 6 pistons , offers up to 126 m&sup3;/h and 30 kW</p><p>W , the most powerful one, comes with 8 pistons , with maximum values of 206 m&sup3;/h and 52 kW</p><p>&ldquo; Frascold was among the first companies to recognise the potential of hydrocarbons for heat pumps and to focus on research and development to transform this intuition into high-performance and reliable solutions &rdquo; said Livio Calabrese, Sales and Marketing Director at Frascold, who concluded &ldquo; The new ATEX-HT series is the result of our deep knowledge of the needs of the industry, also stemming from a long direct experience on the ground with customers , a continuous technological progress and strategic vision, which uses sustainable innovation as major competitive asset in order to reduce operating costs and actively contribute to our Customers&#39; energy transition. &rdquo;</p>\"\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> Ziel war ein ausfallsicheres, skalierbares und sicheres Netzwerk mit 24/7-Support.</p><p> Herausforderung</p><p> Semikron-Danfoss, ein weltweit f\\u00fchrender Hersteller in der Leistungselektronik, strebte eine umfassende Modernisierung seiner Netzwerkinfrastruktur an. Zus\\u00e4tzlich war das Unternehmen mit der Kommunikation und den Reaktionszeiten des bisherigen Dienstleisters unzufrieden und suchte einen neuen Partner f\\u00fcr den Maintenance Service, der eine schnelle Problembehebung und eine kontinuierliche 24/7-Betriebsbereitschaft gew\\u00e4hrleisten konnte. Das Ziel war es, das Risiko von Netzwerkausf\\u00e4llen signifikant zu reduzieren und somit einen zuverl\\u00e4ssigen, stabilen Betrieb sicherzustellen.</p><p> Analyse</p><p> Unser Team f\\u00fchrte eine umfassende Analyse der bestehenden Netzwerkinfrastruktur in der Haustechnik durch, um Schwachstellen zu identifizieren. Dabei zeigte sich, dass die vorhandene Technik nicht mehr den aktuellen Anforderungen an Leistung entsprach und Optimierungspotenziale f\\u00fcr neueste Sicherheitstechnologien bestanden. Die bestehenden Komponenten waren in ihrer Kapazit\\u00e4t eingeschr\\u00e4nkt, was zu Leistungsengp\\u00e4ssen f\\u00fchrte und die Effizienz der betrieblichen Abl\\u00e4ufe beeintr\\u00e4chtigte. Zudem wiesen einzelne Netzwerkbereiche Sicherheitsrisiken auf, da sie nicht mehr den modernen Standards entsprachen und somit potenzielle Angriffspunkte darstellten. Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt war die fehlende Redundanz, wodurch keine Absicherung gegen Unregelm\\u00e4\\u00dfigkeiten gegeben war. Dar\\u00fcber hinaus erschwerte eine uneinheitliche Infrastruktur mit unterschiedlichen Herstellern und Technologien die Wartung und Skalierbarkeit des Netzwerks. Um eine reibungslose Modernisierung sicherzustellen, war es entscheidend, die in der Haustechnik t\\u00e4tigen Hersteller schrittweise auf den neuen Netzwerkring zu migrieren. Nur so konnte eine st\\u00f6rungsfreie Integration erfolgen und Betriebsunterbrechungen auf ein Minimum reduziert werden. Diese Erkenntnisse bildeten die Grundlage f\\u00fcr die anschlie\\u00dfende Neugestaltung der Netzwerkinfrastruktur.</p><p> Umsetzung</p><p> Basierend auf den Ergebnissen der Analyse erstellte HWS einen Plan f\\u00fcr die Neugestaltung des Hausnetzwerks. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Kunden modernisierten wir das Netzwerk f\\u00fcr maximale Leistung, Sicherheit und Zukunftsf\\u00e4higkeit. Dabei wurden 12 zentrale Cisco-Switches in Ring-Topologie installiert, um eine ausfallsichere Architektur zu gew\\u00e4hrleisten. Zus\\u00e4tzliche Hutschienen-Switche optimierten die Anbindung von Anlagen und Steuerger\\u00e4ten. Eine FortiGate-Firewall im HA-Cluster sch\\u00fctzt die Internetverbindung und regelt das Routing zwischen den Subnetzen, w\\u00e4hrend VLAN-Segmentierung die Netzwerksicherheit weiter verst\\u00e4rkt. Ein VPN-Zugang wurde implementiert, um Wartung und Support zu erleichtern. Nach erfolgreicher Implementierung \\u00fcbernahm HWS den Betrieb des Netzwerks im Rahmen eines 24/7 Managed Services mit definierten Service-Level-Agreements (SLAs), die einen kontinuierlichen, reibungslosen Betrieb sicherstellen. Die vereinbarte Reaktionszeit von einer Stunde, egal zu welcher Tageszeit, wurde von der HWS Gruppe weit unterboten. Dies gew\\u00e4hrleistete eine sofortige Reaktionsf\\u00e4higkeit bei \\u00c4nderungsw\\u00fcnschen und trug dazu bei, dass der Betrieb ohne Unterbrechungen weitergef\\u00fchrt werden konnte. Die Modernisierung der Netzwerkinfrastruktur hat Semikron-Danfoss sp\\u00fcrbare Vorteile verschafft. Lesen Sie mehr \\u00fcber die Benefits auf der n\\u00e4chsten Seite.</p><p> Benefits f\\u00fcr den Kunden:</p><p> Durch die Modernisierung der Netzwerkinfrastruktur und die Einf\\u00fchrung eines strukturierten Maintenance Services konnte Semikron-Danfoss sp\\u00fcrbare Verbesserungen in der Redundanz und Sicherheit erzielen. Dank der verbesserten Skalierbarkeit kann das Unternehmen nun problemlos neue Systeme und Hersteller in das Netzwerk integrieren, ohne dass es zu Inkompatibilit\\u00e4ten oder Leistungseinbu\\u00dfen kommt. Die schnellen Reaktionszeiten im 24/7 Managed Service haben zudem dazu beigetragen, dass Probleme fr\\u00fchzeitig erkannt und behoben werden, bevor sie zu kritischen St\\u00f6rungen f\\u00fchren k\\u00f6nnten. Auch aus Mitarbeitersicht sind die positiven Effekte sp\\u00fcrbar: Laut Feedback des technischen Teams hat sich die Arbeitsbelastung durch Netzwerkausf\\u00e4lle erheblich reduziert, und durch den reibungsloseren Betrieb bleibt mehr Zeit f\\u00fcr strategische IT-Projekte.</p><p> Kundenfeedback:</p><p> Seit Beginn unserer Zusammenarbeit \\u00fcberzeugt die HWS mit Zuverl\\u00e4ssigkeit und hoher Expertise. Besonders hervorzuheben ist der unkomplizierte und direkte Kontakt zu den Ansprechpartnern, der unsere Zusammenarbeit effizient und angenehm gestaltet.</p><p> - Matthias Reh; Service Owner; Semikron-Danfoss</p><p> Zur Success Story mit Downloadoption: https://hws-gruppe.de/...</p>\"\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> natural refrigerants such as propane (R290), butane, and isobutane. The compressors can reach fluid temperatures up to 135\\u00b0C, addressing rising demand for low-emission heating and cooling solutions in both industrial and commercial settings.</p><p> Product Overview</p><p> The ATEX-HT line includes four compressor sizes\\\\u2014S, V, Z, and W\\\\u2014with volumetric displacement ranging from 33 to 206 m\\u00b3/h and motor powers from 5 to 52 kW. These compressors are tailored for integration in reversible air-water and water-water heat pumps used in hospitals, wellness centers, shopping malls, and industrial process heating. The series is certified for use in ATEX environments and is compatible with hydrocarbons, offering flexibility and performance in high-temperature operating conditions.</p><p> The compressors offer maximum fluid temperature thresholds of 135\\u00b0C with butane, 115\\u00b0C with isobutane, and 85\\u00b0C with propane. They also feature a wide modulation range, operating down to 25% of maximum capacity to match variable load demands efficiently.</p><p> Technical Innovations</p><p> Key developments in the ATEX-HT range include high-efficiency motors\\\\u2014with optional permanent magnet rotors for the S, V, and Z models\\\\u2014yielding up to 6% performance gains under high torque and low frequency. Valve plates have been reinforced to handle pressure differences exceeding 30 bar, and pistons are treated with an anti-friction coating to reduce wear, improve startup performance, and enhance durability in fluctuating plant conditions.</p><p> Additionally, the compressors use a specially formulated oil with additives optimized for hydrocarbons. This reduces refrigerant dilution and foaming, improves lubrication, and supports effective oil return, eliminating the need for regenerative heat exchangers.</p><p> \\\\u201cFrascold was among the first companies to recognise the potential of hydrocarbons for heat pumps and to focus on research and development to transform this intuition into high-performance and reliable solutions,\\\\u201d said Livio Calabrese, Sales and Marketing Director at Frascold. \\\\u201cThe new ATEX-HT series is the result of our deep knowledge of the needs of the industry, also stemming from a long direct experience on the ground with customers, a continuous technological progress and strategic vision, which uses sustainable innovation as major competitive asset in order to reduce operating costs and actively contribute to our customers' energy transition.\\\\u201d</p>\",\n",

The funding is part of the Heat Pump Investment Accelerator programme and the broader Plan for Change aimed at decarbonising home heating and boosting energy independence.</p><p> Strategic Investment in Heat Pump Supply Chain</p><p> Copeland will use the funding to scale up manufacturing of heating compression technology, a critical component of heat pumps. The move is intended to reduce reliance on imported equipment and help shield UK households from volatile international gas markets. The government confirmed that Copeland will match the public funding with additional private investment, further strengthening its domestic production capabilities.</p><p> Sando Matic, Europe President for Copeland, said: \\\\u201cThis investment marks a pivotal step in advancing clean energy solutions and driving economic growth. By expanding our manufacturing capabilities for heating solutions here in Northern Ireland, Copeland is proud to play a key role in helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and supporting the energy transition to more sustainable, electricity-powered heating.\\\\u201d</p><p> Market Growth and Skills Development</p><p> The announcement comes amid growing consumer interest in heat pumps. The Boiler Upgrade Scheme saw a record 4,028 applications in March 2025\\\\u2014an 88% increase from the same month last year. Under current proposals, the scheme could be expanded to include air-to-air heat pumps and heat batteries, alongside new financing models such as leasing and hire purchase.</p><p> To meet rising demand, the government also pledged to train up to 18,000 additional professionals through the Heat Training Grant and the newly launched Warm Homes Skills Programme. These initiatives aim to prepare more workers to install heat pumps, solar panels, insulation, and heat networks.</p><p> Wider Energy Efficiency Push</p><p> The investment in Copeland is part of a multi-pronged approach to improve the UK's residential energy efficiency. The government is also consulting on new regulations that would require private rental properties to meet an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of C or higher by 2030\\\\u2014up from the current EPC E standard. This regulatory push, combined with increased funding for low-carbon heating, could lift up to one million households out of fuel poverty.</p><p> Quote from Government</p><p> Minister for Energy Consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh stated: \\\\u201cOur Warm Homes Plan will mean lower bills and warmer homes for millions of families \\\\u2013 helping drive better living standards as part of the Plan for Change. We are investing over \\u00a34 million in Copeland to continue building a homegrown heat pump industry and training up the army of skilled workers we need to achieve this.\\\\u201d</p><p> This funding represents a significant step in expanding the UK's low-carbon infrastructure while fostering local economic development and reducing emissions from residential heating.</p>\",\n",

Die offizielle Er\\u00f6ffnung der Anlage fand am 19. Februar 2025 in Anwesenheit des Fl\\u00e4mischen Premierministers Matthias Diependaele und weiterer hochrangiger G\\u00e4ste der beteiligten Unternehmen und der beteiligten Verb\\u00e4nde und Institute statt. Die neue GEA Technologie erm\\u00f6glicht es, industrielle Abw\\u00e4rme auf Temperaturen von 135 bis 160 \\u00b0C zu bringen und zu nutzen. Durch nat\\u00fcrliche K\\u00e4ltemittel \\\\u2013 in diesem Fall Pentan \\\\u2013 und leistungsstarke Verdichter k\\u00f6nnen fossile Brennstoffe in der Industrie und Fernw\\u00e4rme ersetzt werden. Die Hochtemperatur-W\\u00e4rmepumpen sind ein wichtiger Baustein zur Dekarbonisierung, da sie Prozessw\\u00e4rme nachhaltig und energieeffizient erzeugen.<br/><br/><p> Bislang sind industrielle W\\u00e4rmepumpen mittlerer Leistung (500 kW bis 10 MW) \\u00fcberwiegend auf Vorlauftemperaturen von etwa 95 \\u00b0C beschr\\u00e4nkt. GEA leistet mit der neuen Hochtemperatur-W\\u00e4rmepumpe einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Dekarbonisierung des Zuckerproduktionsprozesses bei Tiense Suiker. Die neue Hochtemperatur-W\\u00e4rmepumpe von GEA sorgt f\\u00fcr eine j\\u00e4hrliche Reduzierung der CO\\\\u2082-Emissionen von 3.000 bis 3.500 Tonnen pro Jahr.</p><p> <h> Ausgew\\u00e4hlte Partner des EU-SPIRIT-Projekts </h> GEA und Tiense Suiker sind ausgew\\u00e4hlte Partner des EU-SPIRIT-Projekts. Die getrennten Bewerbungen von Tienske Suiker und GEA bei der EU waren am Ende von Erfolg gekr\\u00f6nt und wurden von einer mit Fachexperten besetzten Kommission f\\u00fcr das SPIRIT ausgew\\u00e4hlt. Das EU-Programm zielt darauf ab, den Einsatz von industriellen W\\u00e4rmepumpen in ganz Europa zu f\\u00f6rdern und damit nachhaltige Technologien zur W\\u00e4rmeaufbereitung in der Industrie einzuf\\u00fchren. Durch den verst\\u00e4rkten Einsatz industrieller W\\u00e4rmepumpen, die \\u00fcbersch\\u00fcssige W\\u00e4rme aufbereiten und nutzen, k\\u00f6nnen Unternehmen nicht nur ihre Betriebskosten senken, sondern auch ihren \\u00f6kologischen Fu\\u00dfabdruck verringern und zur Erreichung der Klimaziele der EU beitragen. SPIRIT wird durch das Rahmenprogramm \\\\u201eHorizon Europe\\\\u201c finanziert, das Forschungs- und Innovationsprogramm der EU, \\u00fcber das Wissenschaft und Industrie bei der Entwicklung nachhaltiger und innovativer L\\u00f6sungen f\\u00fcr globale Herausforderungen unterst\\u00fctzt werden.</p><p> Die Herausforderung bei Tiense Suiker: Dekarbonisierung des Zuckerraffinerieprozess</p><p> In der industriellen Zuckerproduktion wird Zucker aus Zuckerr\\u00fcben oder Zuckerrohr durch Extraktion, Verdampfung und Kristallisation gewonnen. Kessel erzeugen den daf\\u00fcr erforderlichen Dampf. Traditionell werden f\\u00fcr die Erhitzung der Kessel fossile Brennstoffe genutzt. Das langfristige Ziel von Tiense Suiker ist es, den Zuckerraffinerieprozess vollst\\u00e4ndig zu dekarbonisieren. Der erste Schritt zur Erreichung dieses Ziels ist die Teilnahme am SPIRIT-Projekt und in diesem Rahmen die Integration einer GEA Hochtemperatur-W\\u00e4rmepumpe in das Herzst\\u00fcck des Produktionsprozesses. Bei der integrierten Technologie handelt es sich um eine Dampferzeugung mit Pentan als nat\\u00fcrliches K\\u00e4ltemittel und einem Schraubenverdichter. Diese Technologie nutzt Vakuumdampf mit einer Temperatur zwischen 75 \\u00b0C und 92 \\u00b0C aus der Eindampfanlage als W\\u00e4rmequelle zur Erzeugung von Dampf mit einer Temperatur von circa 139 \\u00b0C und einer Leistung von 4 MW.</p><p> <h> Wissenschaftliche Begleitung durch renommierte Wissenschaftsinstitutionen </h> GEA arbeitet bei der Implementierung der Hochtemperatur-W\\u00e4rmepumpe bei Tiense Suiker mit renommierten Partnern aus Wissenschaft und Verb\\u00e4nden zusammen. Als Projektpartner konnten das \\\\u201eDanish Technological Institute\\\\u201c (DTI), ein f\\u00fchrendes Forschungs- und Technologieunternehmen, die \\\\u201eNiederl\\u00e4ndische Organisation f\\u00fcr Angewandte Naturwissenschaftliche Forschung\\\\u201c (TNO), die \\\\u201eEuropean Heat Pump Association\\\\u201c (EHPA) und zur Bereitstellung von Software und Unterst\\u00fctzung bei Systemsimulation die \\\\u201eTLK Energy GmbH\\\\u201c (TLK) aus Aachen, Deutschland, gewonnen werden. All diese Projektpartner arbeiten aktuell und zuk\\u00fcnftig eng zusammen und analysieren gemeinsam und in engem Austausch auch zuk\\u00fcnftig Daten und Erkenntnisse \\u00fcber die Hochtemperatur-W\\u00e4rmepumpe bei Tiense Suiker. Diese Partnerschaft und das Zusammenf\\u00fchren von Kompetenzen, Erkenntnissen und Analysen ist es, was f\\u00fcr alle Beteiligten dieses Projekt so aufschlussreich und f\\u00fcr zuk\\u00fcnftige Hochtemperatur-W\\u00e4rmepumpen-Projekte auch in anderen Industrien und Bereichen hochinteressant ist.</p>\"\n",
