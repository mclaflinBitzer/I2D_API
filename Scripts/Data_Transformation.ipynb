Auch wenn unver\\u00e4ndert Kritikpunkte bleiben, gilt das Gesetz insbesondere unter Experten als Meilenstein auf dem Weg zu einer Senkung der CO -Emissionen von Geb\\u00e4uden. Die Komplexit\\u00e4t der gesetzlichen Vorgaben allerdings bereitet vielen Anwendern noch immer Schwierigkeiten und hat inzwischen auch in der Politik den Ruf nach einer Vereinfachung der Regelungen laut werden lassen. Ob \\\\u2013 und wenn ja, bis wann \\\\u2013 solche Vereinfachungen tats\\u00e4chlich umgesetzt werden, ist Stand heute indes noch offen.</p><p> Praxisnahe L\\u00f6sungen f\\u00fcr den Arbeitsalltag</p><p> Vor diesem Hintergrund bem\\u00fchen sich im Danfoss Live Online-Event \\\\u201eRethink Live InTalk GEG 2025\\\\u201c (03. Juni 2025 von 11:00 Uhr bis 12:30 Uhr) drei ausgewiesene Geb\\u00e4udetechnik-Spezialisten um eine Beantwortung der wichtigsten Fragen rund um das novellierte Gesetz. Unter dem Motto diskutieren Dr. Peter Hug, Gesch\\u00e4ftsf\\u00fchrer des Fachverbandes Automation und Management f\\u00fcr Haus und Geb\\u00e4ude im VDMA, Dr.-Ing. Johannes Peter F\\u00fctterer, Gr\\u00fcnder und CEO der aedifion GmbH sowie Christoph Adams B.A., Key Account Manager \\\\u2013 Building Automation bei Danfoss \\u00fcber die neuen gesetzlichen Anforderungen und stellen praxisnahe L\\u00f6sungen f\\u00fcr den Arbeitsalltag vor. Ein besonderes Augenmerk gilt der intelligenten Geb\\u00e4udeautomation, deren Realisierung in \\u00a7 71a GEG zum Teil sogar erstmals zur Vorschrift erhoben worden ist und die auch \\u00fcber das GEG hinaus als effektivster und zukunftstr\\u00e4chtigster Weg zur Optimierung der Geb\\u00e4udeenergieeffizienz betrachtet werden kann.</p><p> Im Rahmen des Live Online-Events erhalten die Zuschauer detaillierte Infos dar\\u00fcber, wie sie die komplexen Anforderungen des neuen GEG einfach und effektiv erf\\u00fcllen k\\u00f6nnen \\\\u2013 mit dem Ergebnis, dass durch die Steigerung der Geb\\u00e4udeenergieeffizienz sowohl CO -Emissionen als auch Betriebskosten dauerhaft sinken. Der Beitrag, den dabei insbesondere eine intelligente Geb\\u00e4udeautomation leistet, wird durch Best Practices aus beispielhaften Anwendungsf\\u00e4llen erl\\u00e4utert. Zudem gibt es Tipps zum Austausch mit Branchenexperten und zur gezielten Erweiterung des eigenen Netzwerks. \\\\u25a0</p><p> Quelle: Danfoss / ml</p><p> Keine Zeit?

      "            \"summary\": \" May 13, 2025 HUZHOU, China \\\\u2013 Danfoss Power Solutions\\\\u2019 Editron division has delivered its first eHydraulic Power Module to SANY for the electrification of a 200-tonne lattice-boom crawler crane.\",\n",
      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> The eHydraulic system integrates a Danfoss Editron synchronous reluctance assisted permanent magnet motor with a Danfoss variable displacement axial piston pump to maximize performance and efficiency. SANY launched the fully electric battery-operated crane earlier this year.</p><p> Construction machinery worldwide emits an estimated 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, according to IDTechEx. With the scale of global construction activity set to increase significantly in the decades to come, decarbonizing heavy-duty machinery is vital to curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Leading crane manufacturer SANY is supporting these efforts and helping its customers achieve zero-emission construction sites through the electrification of its lattice- and telescopic-boom crawler cranes.</p><p> SANY is working to develop fully electric versions of its higher capacity crawler cranes, having previously electrified its lower capacity models. Danfoss supplies Editron motors and D1P pumps for SANY's 80- to 150-tonne cranes. For its 200-tonne platform, SANY opted for an integrated Danfoss eHydraulic Power Module to power the traction and work function systems. Comprising an Editron PMI375-T1100 motor and D1P 260-cc pump, the system is optimized to deliver peak performance and maximize hydraulic system efficiency, extending machine runtime on a single charge. The full hydraulics system also includes a Danfoss Series 90 pump and PVG 128 valve.</p><p> SANY realized additional benefits with the Danfoss eHydraulic Power Module, including a compact package with mechanical advantages, simple installation, and high reliability. Supplying the electric motor and hydraulic pump as an integrated package eliminates the risk of noise, vibration, and component damage that can arise when using a flexible coupling to join the components. It also simplifies and accelerates installation as there's no need for the OEM to connect the components. CE marks and Danfoss' global service network were also key reasons SANY chose to partner with Danfoss on the project.</p><p> \\\\u201cBuilding a solution for SANY's high-capacity platform with the Danfoss integrated eHydraulic Power Module marks a milestone,\\\\u201d said Roy Chen, President, Editron division, Danfoss Power Solutions. \\\\u201ceHydraulics represents the future. Together with our Controls division, we have designed a system combining our D1P pump and Editron motor while tuning controls algorithms to maximize efficiency. We look forward to our continued collaboration with SANY and supporting their green journey.\\\\u201d</p><p> \\\\u201cConventional hydraulics still plays a role in the electrification of heavy machinery, particularly machines of this size,\\\\u201d said Henrik J\\u00f8rgensen, President, Controls division, Danfoss Power Solutions. \\\\u201cBy integrating Danfoss' advanced hydraulic solutions and electrification technology, we are empowering a smooth transition to more sustainable operations. Leveraging our eHydraulic solutions and our application know-how, we aspire to be the partner of choice for visionary OEMs like SANY.\\\\u201d</p><p> To learn more about Danfoss solutions for electrification, visit Danfoss.com/Editron.</p><p> https://www.danfoss.com</p>\",\n",
