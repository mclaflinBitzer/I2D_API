Auch wenn unver\\u00e4ndert Kritikpunkte bleiben, gilt das Gesetz insbesondere unter Experten als Meilenstein auf dem Weg zu einer Senkung der CO -Emissionen von Geb\\u00e4uden. Die Komplexit\\u00e4t der gesetzlichen Vorgaben allerdings bereitet vielen Anwendern noch immer Schwierigkeiten und hat inzwischen auch in der Politik den Ruf nach einer Vereinfachung der Regelungen laut werden lassen. Ob \\\\u2013 und wenn ja, bis wann \\\\u2013 solche Vereinfachungen tats\\u00e4chlich umgesetzt werden, ist Stand heute indes noch offen.</p><p> Praxisnahe L\\u00f6sungen f\\u00fcr den Arbeitsalltag</p><p> Vor diesem Hintergrund bem\\u00fchen sich im Danfoss Live Online-Event \\\\u201eRethink Live InTalk GEG 2025\\\\u201c (03. Juni 2025 von 11:00 Uhr bis 12:30 Uhr) drei ausgewiesene Geb\\u00e4udetechnik-Spezialisten um eine Beantwortung der wichtigsten Fragen rund um das novellierte Gesetz. Unter dem Motto diskutieren Dr. Peter Hug, Gesch\\u00e4ftsf\\u00fchrer des Fachverbandes Automation und Management f\\u00fcr Haus und Geb\\u00e4ude im VDMA, Dr.-Ing. Johannes Peter F\\u00fctterer, Gr\\u00fcnder und CEO der aedifion GmbH sowie Christoph Adams B.A., Key Account Manager \\\\u2013 Building Automation bei Danfoss \\u00fcber die neuen gesetzlichen Anforderungen und stellen praxisnahe L\\u00f6sungen f\\u00fcr den Arbeitsalltag vor. Ein besonderes Augenmerk gilt der intelligenten Geb\\u00e4udeautomation, deren Realisierung in \\u00a7 71a GEG zum Teil sogar erstmals zur Vorschrift erhoben worden ist und die auch \\u00fcber das GEG hinaus als effektivster und zukunftstr\\u00e4chtigster Weg zur Optimierung der Geb\\u00e4udeenergieeffizienz betrachtet werden kann.</p><p> Im Rahmen des Live Online-Events erhalten die Zuschauer detaillierte Infos dar\\u00fcber, wie sie die komplexen Anforderungen des neuen GEG einfach und effektiv erf\\u00fcllen k\\u00f6nnen \\\\u2013 mit dem Ergebnis, dass durch die Steigerung der Geb\\u00e4udeenergieeffizienz sowohl CO -Emissionen als auch Betriebskosten dauerhaft sinken. Der Beitrag, den dabei insbesondere eine intelligente Geb\\u00e4udeautomation leistet, wird durch Best Practices aus beispielhaften Anwendungsf\\u00e4llen erl\\u00e4utert. Zudem gibt es Tipps zum Austausch mit Branchenexperten und zur gezielten Erweiterung des eigenen Netzwerks. \\\\u25a0</p><p> Quelle: Danfoss / ml</p><p> Keine Zeit?

Accompanied by a delegation of eight Danish companies including Danfoss, the Danish minister met key officials, including Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao, Party Secretary of Tianjin Chen Miner, and the Mayor of Tianjin Zhang Gong.</p><p> Danfoss' Tianjin factory, established in 1996, is a cornerstone of Danfoss' operations in China. It is Danfoss' first factory in China, and it produces advanced components for HVAC, refrigeration, and industrial applications, as well as high-efficiency heat meters that help reduce energy consumption in buildings.</p><p> In 2019, the World Economic Forum recognized the Tianjin facility as a \\\\u2018Lighthouse Factory', placing it among the world's most advanced manufacturing sites thanks to its use of AI-powered inspections, intelligent sensors, and fully automated monitoring systems.</p><p> Running entirely on renewable electricity from a nearby solar farm, the site expanded in 2023 with the launch of the Global Green Refrigerants Compressors Laboratory, a 7,000-square-meter R&amp;D center dedicated to the development of sustainable technologies for heat pumps, air conditioning, and data center cooling.</p><p> Danfoss' presence in China is set to grow further this year with the upcoming completion of its Haiyan campus, which will become the company's largest global production hub. The new facility spans 126,000 square meters and is designed to also run entirely on green power.</p><p> \\\\u201cIt's quite thought-provoking how the relationship between China and Denmark may span 75 years, yet has developed tremendously over the past 25 to 30 years. From \\\\u2013 at least in economic terms \\\\u2013 playing only a minor role, with few exceptions, to the point around 30 years ago when the first Danish companies established a presence in China. Danfoss is a great example of that development. It becomes very tangible when visiting this campus, which will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year, and seeing how it forms an integrated part of Danfoss' global value creation chain. I find it genuinely interesting to witness that firsthand.</p><p> Lars L\\u00f8kke Rasmussen</p><p> Arthur Xu, President of Danfoss China, says:</p><p> \\\\u201cChina is accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to electrified, energy-efficient industrial processes, and at Danfoss, we have the technologies to help drive that transition while strengthening competitiveness. China is not only our second home market but also a hub of innovation, talent, and long-term partnerships. The visit by the Danish Foreign Minister and the Danish business delegation reinforces our commitment to turn decarbonization into a powerful driver of value creation and competitive advantage for all.\\\\u201d</p><p> The long-standing relationship between Danfoss and China has been recognized at the highest levels. In 2017, former CEO and Chairman of the Board, J\\u00f8rgen Mads Clausen, received the Haihe Friendship Award from the city of Tianjin, followed by the prestigious Chinese Government Friendship Award in 2018 \\\\u2013 one of the country's top honors for foreign experts contributing to national development.</p><p> Danfoss currently has 12 production and innovation facilities in China and approximately 5,500 employees in the country.</p><p> https://www.danfoss.com</p>\",\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> The Danish Foreign Minister visited China May 17-19 in connection with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of Denmark and the People's Republic of China. Accompanied by a delegation of eight Danish companies including Danfoss, the Danish minister met key officials, including Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao, Party Secretary of Tianjin Chen Miner, and the Mayor of Tianjin Zhang Gong.</p><p> Danfoss' Tianjin factory, established in 1996, is a cornerstone of Danfoss' operations in China. It is Danfoss' first factory in China, and it produces advanced components for HVAC, refrigeration, and industrial applications, as well as high-efficiency heat meters that help reduce energy consumption in buildings.</p><p> It's quite thought-provoking how the relationship between China and Denmark may span 75 years, yet has developed tremendously over the past 25 to 30 years. From \\\\u2013 at least in economic terms \\\\u2013 playing only a minor role, with few exceptions, to the point around 30 years ago when the first Danish companies established a presence in China. Danfoss is a great example of that development. It becomes very tangible when visiting this campus, which will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year, and seeing how it forms an integrated part of Danfoss' global value creation chain. I find it genuinely interesting to witness that firsthand.</p><p> Arthur Xu, President of Danfoss China, says:</p><p> \\\\u201cChina is accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to electrified, energy-efficient industrial processes, and at Danfoss, we have the technologies to help drive that transition while strengthening competitiveness. China is not only our second home market but also a hub of innovation, talent, and long-term partnerships. The visit by the Danish Foreign Minister and the Danish business delegation reinforces our commitment to turn decarbonization into a powerful driver of value creation and competitive advantage for all.\\\\u201d</p><p> The long-standing relationship between Danfoss and China has been recognized at the highest levels. In 2017, former CEO and Chairman of the Board, J\\u00f8rgen Mads Clausen, received the Haihe Friendship Award from the city of Tianjin, followed by the prestigious Chinese Government Friendship Award in 2018 \\\\u2013 one of the country's top honors for foreign experts contributing to national development.</p><p> Danfoss currently has 12 production and innovation facilities in China and approximately 5,500 employees in the country.</p><p> For further information, contact:</p><p> Ken, Xiao Qiang, Public Relations Director, Danfoss China</p><p> xiaoqiang@danfoss.com</p>\",\n",
