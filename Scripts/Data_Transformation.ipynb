The core of the partnership is the integration of Danfoss' cloud-based Leanheat\\u00ae Building software with E.ON One's Intelligent Heating Control Box (IHC). The joint solution targets housing companies, property managers, investors, and operators of heating networks.</p><p> Digitization meets heating technology: A solution for the energy and heating transition</p><p> The combined solution is easy to install and enables dynamic, demand-optimized control of heating systems\\\\u2014taking into account weather data, building thermodynamics, consumption patterns, and network signals. This allows for up to 30% heating energy savings and significant reductions in CO\\\\u2082 emissions. The system is suitable for both existing and new buildings and can be implemented without extensive renovations.</p><p> The partnership responds to current industry developments: rising energy prices, increasing regulatory requirements under EU climate policy, and the need for scalable, digital solutions in the building sector.</p><p> This partnership is an important step towards an intelligent, climate-friendly building sector. Together with Danfoss, we offer a digital solution that combines economic efficiency and climate protection\\\\u2014and is easily scalable.</p><p> Pilot projects show potential savings - Europe-wide scaling planned</p><p> The strategic partnership will start in the second quarter of 2025 with initial pilot projects in Germany. Early results already show a strong reduction in energy consumption.</p><p> Further installations with energy providers and housing companies are planned for the third quarter of 2025. By the end of the year, the solution is to be rolled out in markets such as Poland, Sweden, and Finland. Further scaling to additional European countries is planned for 2026.</p><p> Technological Basis: Intelligent Heating Control from the Cloud</p><p> The technological basis for the intelligent heating control by Danfoss and E.ON One is a combination of E.ON One's Intelligent Heating Control Box (IHC) and Danfoss' cloud-based Leanheat Building software.</p><p> The IHC Box connects the heating room through integrated sensors and cloud connectivity. It continuously captures relevant measurements such as outdoor, supply, and return temperatures. These data are transmitted to Leanheat Building, a proven AI-based software for optimizing heating systems, which has already been successfully used in over 200,000 apartments, mainly in Nordic countries, and is now to be scaled further for the heterogeneous markets in Germany and Central Europe.</p><p> Leanheat analyzes the data from the IHC Box and additionally considers factors such as weather forecasts, building thermodynamics, and consumption patterns to automatically and dynamically adjust heating curves for each building individually, ensuring efficient and demand-driven heat distribution.</p><p> Building operators also benefit from a dashboard that offers comprehensive monitoring and control functions. If optimized properties are connected to heating networks, energy providers benefit from virtual heat storage or flexibility through demand response. This allows providers to manage their heating networks more efficiently overall.</p><p> The strength of our partnership lies in offering a comprehensive and state-of-the-art solution for intelligent heating control, characterized by its easy implementation. Leanheat Building, in combination with E.ON One's IHC technology, makes it easier than ever for housing companies and heating network operators to optimize their heating systems and contribute to the energy transition.</p><p> The partnership makes a measurable contribution to achieving European climate goals and offers a concrete solution for the decarbonization of the building stock.</p><p> For further information please contact:</p><p> Mareike Eckrich Elholm, Communications Team Lead at Danfoss Climate Solutions</p><p> Phone: +45 28 55 36 16</p><p> Email: Mareike.Eckrich@danfoss.com</p><p> Anne Lathouwers, Head of Growth Marketing and Communication</p><p> Phone: +31 611731109</p><p> Email: anne.lathouwers@eon.com</p>\"\n",

      "            \"newslinetext\": \"<p> E.ON One and Danfoss are combining their expertise to create a scalable solution for intelligent heating optimization. The core of the partnership is the integration of Danfoss' cloud-based Leanheat\\u00ae Building software with E.ON One's Intelligent Heating Control Box (IHC). The joint solution targets housing companies, property managers, investors, and operators of heating networks.</p><p> Digitization meets heating technology: A solution for the energy and heating transition</p><p> The combined solution is easy to install and enables dynamic, demand-optimized control of heating systems\\\\u2014taking into account weather data, building thermodynamics, consumption patterns, and network signals. This allows for up to 30% heating energy savings and significant reductions in CO\\\\u2082 emissions. The system is suitable for both existing and new buildings and can be implemented without extensive renovations.</p><p> The partnership responds to current industry developments: rising energy prices, increasing regulatory requirements under EU climate policy, and the need for scalable, digital solutions in the building sector.</p><p> \\\"This partnership is an important step towards an intelligent, climate-friendly building sector. Together with Danfoss, we offer a digital solution that combines economic efficiency and climate protection\\\\u2014and is easily scalable.</p><p> Tim van Amstel, CEO of E.ON One</p><p> Pilot projects show potential savings - Europe-wide scaling planned</p><p> The strategic partnership will start in the second quarter of 2025 with initial pilot projects in Germany. Early results already show a strong reduction in energy consumption.</p><p> Further installations with energy providers and housing companies are planned for the third quarter of 2025. By the end of the year, the solution is to be rolled out in markets such as Poland, Sweden, and Finland. Further scaling to additional European countries is planned for 2026.</p><p> Technological Basis: Intelligent Heating Control from the Cloud</p><p> The technological basis for the intelligent heating control by Danfoss and E.ON One is a combination of E.ON One's Intelligent Heating Control Box (IHC) and Danfoss' cloud-based Leanheat Building software.</p><p> The IHC Box connects the heating room through integrated sensors and cloud connectivity. It continuously captures relevant measurements such as outdoor, supply, and return temperatures. These data are transmitted to Leanheat Building, a proven AI-based software for optimizing heating systems, which has already been successfully used in over 200,000 apartments, mainly in Nordic countries, and is now to be scaled further for the heterogeneous markets in Germany and Central Europe.</p><p> Leanheat analyzes the data from the IHC Box and additionally considers factors such as weather forecasts, building thermodynamics, and consumption patterns to automatically and dynamically adjust heating curves for each building individually, ensuring efficient and demand-driven heat distribution.</p><p> Building operators also benefit from a dashboard that offers comprehensive monitoring and control functions. If optimized properties are connected to heating networks, energy providers benefit from virtual heat storage or flexibility through demand response. This allows providers to manage their heating networks more efficiently overall.</p><p> \\\"The strength of our partnership lies in offering a comprehensive and state-of-the-art solution for intelligent heating control, characterized by its easy implementation. Leanheat Building, in combination with E.ON One's IHC technology, makes it easier than ever for housing companies and heating network operators to optimize their heating systems and contribute to the energy transition.</p><p> Natalie Schnippering, Vice President of Danfoss Climate Solutions Digital Services</p><p> The partnership makes a measurable contribution to achieving European climate goals and offers a concrete solution for the decarbonization of the building stock.</p><p> https://www.danfoss.com</p>\",\n",
